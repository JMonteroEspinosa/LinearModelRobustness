# LinearModelRobustness
A simple Shiny App built for the course Developing Data Products, Coursera. Its purpose is to allow researchers as well as students to explore how the p-value of the slope of a simple linear regression varies with changes to:
- The underlying functional relationship
- The presence of outliers (that you can add by clicking on the plot!)
- The variance of the error term
- The number of observations
- The slope of the relationship

In future versions, the app may allow to transform your independent variable (x) before running the regression, or even allow for polynomial transformations of x!
